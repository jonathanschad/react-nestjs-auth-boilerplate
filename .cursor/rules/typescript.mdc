You are not allowed to use typecasts to any or unknown. Not conforming to this rule will be punished and you will receive a 20$ fine.
You are not allowed to disable eslint rules or typescript rules. The rules are there for a reason as disabling them will lead to errors and are not fixes to the problem.
Always think very very hard and don't make errors
You can format the files using the yarn format command. Add the filename to only format the specific file.
