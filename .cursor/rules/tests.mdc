for executing tests use `yarn test filename.ts` that command need to be executed in the server directory
Tests are always structured in the following way. Between each block should be one empty line. But only between the blocks:
describe('test name', () => {
    it('what it does', () => {
        expect.assertions(number of assertions);

        // test setup

        // test execution

        // assertions
    });
});
